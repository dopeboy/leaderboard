					Mundaii does not decide if you should charge patients for consultation. mundaii charges you 5% of the consultation fee that you charge the patient for providing your opinion through mundaii. This covers the financial transaction charges that mundaii incurs while transferring payments from patients to physicians / providers with an additional small margin.
					Of course, you are free to provide consultations at no charge to patients, in order to promote your practice. In cases, where you provide consultation services free to patients, mundaii will not be receiving any payment from either you or the patient. The amount you charge a patient for consultation is entirely up to you and your patient to mutually agree upon.
